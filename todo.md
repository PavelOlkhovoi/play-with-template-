Room for improvement.

1. Need to change the algorithm for linking tables using typeCids.
   Current version breaks when using complex names. I've tried this before. The code is too confusing.
   Need to start over with simple examples with vzkat_zeichen_art.

2. When I try to enable interactive drag and drop with, the infinite reender is invoked.
   onNodesChange={onNodesChange}
   onEdgesChange={onEdgesChange}
